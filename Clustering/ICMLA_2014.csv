1,Ensemble Statistical and Heuristic Models for Unsupervised Word Alignment,"statistical word alignment, ensemble learning, heuristic word alignment","Statistical word alignment models need large amount of training data while they are weak in small-size corpora. This paper proposes a new approach of unsupervised hybrid word alignment technique using ensemble learning method. This algorithm uses three base alignment models in several rounds to generate alignments. The ensemble algorithm uses a weighed scheme for resampling training data and a voting score to consider aggregated alignments. The underlying alignment algorithms used in this study include IBM Model 1, 2 and a heuristic method based on Dice measurement. Our experimental results show that by this approach, the alignment error rate could be improved by at least %15 for the base alignment models.",Ensemble Methods
2,Improving Spectral Learning by Using Multiple Representations,"representation, spectral learning, discrete Fourier, basis selection, ensemble","Spectral learning algorithms learn an unknown function by learning a spectral (e.g., Fourier) representation of the function. However, there are many possible spectral representations, none of which will be best in all situations. Consequently, it seems natural to consider how a spectral learner could make use of multiple representations when learning. This paper proposes and compares three approaches to learning from multiple spectral representations. Empirical results suggest that an ensemble approach to multi-spectrum learning, in which spectral models are learned independently in each of a set of candidate representations and then combined in a majority-vote ensemble, works best in practice.",Ensemble Methods
3,Applying Swarm Ensemble Clustering Technique for Fault Prediction Using Software Metrics,"Software defect prediction, Particle swarm optimization, Cluster data, Ensemble clustering","Number of defects remaining in a system provides an insight into the quality of the system. Defect detection systems predict defects by using software metrics and data mining techniques. Clustering analysis is adopted to build the software defect prediction models. Cluster ensembles have emerged as a prominent method for improving robustness, stability and accuracy of clustering solutions. The clustering ensembles combine multiple partitions generated by different clustering algorithms into a single clustering solution. In this paper, the clustering ensemble using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) solution is proposed to improve the predict quality. An empirical study shows that the PSO can be a good choice to build defect prediction software  models.",Ensemble Methods
4,Reducing the Effects of Detrimental Instances,"filtering, label noise, instance weighting","Not all instances in a data set are equally beneficial for inducing a model of the data. Some instances (such as outliers or noise) can be detrimental. However, at least initially, the instances in a data set are generally considered equally in machine learning algorithms. Many current approaches for handling noisy and detrimental instances make a binary decision about whether an instance is detrimental or not. In this paper, we 1) extend this paradigm by weighting the instances on a continuous scale and 2) present a methodology for measuring how detrimental an instance may be for inducing a model of the data. We call our method of identifying and weighting detrimental instances reduced detrimental instance learning (RDIL). We examine RIDL on a set of 54 data sets and 5 learning algorithms and compare RIDL with other weighting and filtering approaches. RDIL is especially useful for learning algorithms where every instance can affect the classification boundary and the training instances are considered individually, such as multilayer perceptrons trained with backpropagation (MLPs). Our results also suggest that a more accurate estimate of which instances are detrimental can have a significant positive impact for handling them.",Ensemble Methods
5,Concept Drift Awareness in Twitter Streams,"Twitter, Adaptation models, Time-frequency analysis, Event detection, Context, Vectors","Learning in non-stationary environments is not an easy task and requires a distinctive approach. The learning model must not only have the ability to continuously learn, but also the ability to change already acquired concepts. Additionally, given the significant importance that social networks gained as information networks, there is an ever-growing interest in the extraction of complex information used for trend detection, promoting services or market sensing. This dynamic nature tends to limit the performance of traditional static learning models and dynamic learning strategies must be put forward. In this paper we present a learning strategy to learn in the presence of concept drift in Twitter. We propose three different models: a time-window model, an ensemble-based model and an incremental model. Since little is known about the types of drift that can occur in Twitter, we simulate different types of drift by artificially timestamping real Twitter messages in order to evaluate and validate our strategy. Results are so far encouraging regarding learning in the presence of drift, along with classifying messages in Twitter streams.",Ensemble Methods
6,High Precision Screening for Android Malware with Dimensionality Reduction,"dimensionality reduction, mobile security, android, principal components analysis","This work presents a new method of classifying previously unseen Android applications as malware or benign. The algorithm starts with a large set of features: the frequencies of all possible n-byte sequences in the application's byte code. Principal components analysis is applied to that frequency matrix in order to reduce it to a low-dimensional representation, which is then fed into any of several classification algorithms. We utilize the implicitly restarted Lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm and exploit the sparsity of the n-gram frequency matrix in order to efficiently compute the low-dimensional representation. When trained upon that low-dimensional representation, several classification algorithms achieve higher accuracy than previous work.",Applications in Security
7,Reducing the Cost of Breaking Audio CAPTCHAs by Active and Semi-Supervised Learning,"active learning, semi-supervised learning, audio CAPTCHA, automatic speech recognition","CAPTCHAs are challenge-response tests that are widely used in the Internet to distinguish human users from machines. In addition to the well-known visual CAPTCHAs, most Internet services also provide an audio-based scheme, e.g., to enable access for visually impaired users. Recent research has shown that most CAPTCHAs are vulnerable as they can be broken by machine learning techniques. However, such automated attacks come at a relatively high cost as they require human experts to create labels for the unlabeled CAPTCHA samples collected from a website in order to train an attacking system.In this work we utilize active and semi-supervised learning methods for breaking audio CAPTCHAs. We show that these methods can reduce the labeling costs considerably, resulting in an increased vulnerability of audio CAPTCHAs as automated attacks are rendered even more worthwhile.In addition, our findings give insight into improvements to the design of CAPTCHAs, helping to harden prospective audio CAPTCHA schemes against active learning attacks in the future.""""""",Applications in Security

The same reinforcement learning techniques developed for network security can be applied to software security as well. This research summarizes a work in progress attempt to incorporate Q-learning algorithm in software security. The Q-learning method is embedded as part of the software itself to provide a security mechanism that has ability to learn by itself to develop a temporary repair mechanism. The results of the experiment express that given the right parameters and the right setting the Q-learning approach rapidly learns to block all alicious actions. Data analysis on the Q-values produced by the software can provide security diagnostic as well. A larger scale experiment is expected to be seen in the future work.,Applications in Security
9,On-line Signature Verification using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO),"Signature,Discretize,Unordered,Classification,Training,Bag-of-pattern","Signatures are the single most widely used method of identifying an individual but they carry with them an alarmingly significant amount of vulnerabilities implying a need for an effective and robust method of precisely identifying an individuals signature. The signature of an individual is visually acquired by using pen based tracking system (1), (2). This paper considers the possibility of discretizing visually acquired signatures to represent them as an unordered collection of words and then use Sequential Mining Optimization (SMO) for training Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the signature as either legitimate or forged. The discretizing of the signature is done by using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) (4). SAX reduces the dimensions of the signature and produces a list of SAX words which are then represented as a bag-of-patterns model for classification purposes (5). The data set consisted of more than 3960 signatures of 106 subjects distributed across two sets. The results obtained provided good classification accuracy and additionally provided an insight into the unique pattern of each subjects signature.",Applications in Security
10,Detection of abnormal human behavior using a matrix approximation-based approach,"abnormal event detection, low-rank approximation, adaptive learning","Automatic detection of abnormal events is one of central tasks in video surveillance. In this paper we present a matrix approximation-based method to detect abnormal human behavior. In our model, a behavior pattern is represented by a motion matrix obtained through object tracking. We model typical motions associated with normal behaviors with a set of motion subspaces, computed through low-rank matrix approximation. Then, abnormal human behaviors are identified by the motion deviations from the representative subspaces. Our method does not require a complicated classification procedure, and can fast detect abnormal events in complex scenes. In addition, through the adaptive learning module, our model is built on the observed data, and can be expanded by incorporating new behavior patterns during the detection process. The results on simulated surveillance videos show the effectiveness of our method.",Applications in Security

This problem has been widely investigated using different methods including probabilistic and Markovian approaches. The focus of this paper is to perform activity recognition more accuractely than existing approaches. We represent motion sensors of smart environments in a graph and residents movements as edges in the graph.Then graph-based features are extracted and used as input for a Support Vector Machine. These features have been combined with motion-sensor based features. This method has been compared with three other widely used approaches, Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) on three different datasets from three smart aparments. In all cases, the method based on graphical features outpeformed existing approaches.",Feature Extraction and Selection
12,"An Accurate, Fast Embedded Feature Selection for SVMs","RFE, feature selection, embedded methods, Support Vector Machines, Recursive Feature Addition","Feature selection is still a vital area for research in the machine learning field. After the emergence of big data, the need for mining large data sizes has increased to provide faster and more accurate predictions. Feature selection is concerned with selecting the most important features from a set of input features since some datasets may contain irrelevant and/or redundant features. In this paper, a new feature selection method of type embedded is presented and discussed with some preliminary results using existing benchmark datasets. The new method is called Recursive Feature Addition which works in a forward fashion and is based on Support Vector Machines. The new method has been applied to five different benchmark datasets and for which it has shown superior performance in terms of accuracy and time as compared to Filter, Wrapper and other Embedded methods.",Feature Extraction and Selection
13,Learning Good Features To Track,"Object Tracking, Convolutional Neural Network, Feature Learning","Object tracking is an important task within the field of computer vision. Tracking accuracy depends mainly on finding good discriminative features to estimate the target location. In this paper, we introduce online feature learning in tracking and propose to learn good features to track generic objects using online convolutional neural networks (OCNN). OCNN has two feature mapping layers that are trained offline based on unlabeled data. In tracking, it is also augmented with a classifier to provide a decision. In order to learn discriminative and stable features for tracking, we propose a novel object function to train OCNN by penalizing the feature variations in consecutive frames. We build a tracking system by combining OCNN and a color-based multi-appearance model. Our experimental results on publicly available video datasets show that the tracking system has superior performance when compared with several state-of-the-art trackers.",Feature Extraction and Selection
14,Feature Selections for Effectively Localizing Faulty Events in GUI Applications,"GUI, feature selection, faults localization","Due to the complex causality of failure and the special characteristics of test cases, the faults in GUI (Graphic User Interface) applications are difficult to localize. This paper adapts feature selection algorithms to localize GUI-related faults in a given program. Features are defined as the subsequences of events executed. By employing statistical feature ranking techniques, the events can be ranked by the suspiciousness of events being responsible to exhibit faulty behavior. The features defined in a given source code implementing (event handle) the underlying event are then ranked in suspiciousness order. The evaluation of the proposed technique based on some open source Java projects verified the effectiveness of this feature selection based fault localization technique for GUI applications.",Feature Extraction and Selection
15,Dimensionality Reduction in Statistical Learning,"Statistical Learning, Dimensionality Reduction, Manifold Learning, Tangent Bundle Manifold Learning, Unsupervised Learning","Many Statistical Learning tasks deal with data which are presented in high dimensional spaces, and the curse of dimensionality phenomena is often an obstacle to the use of many methods for solving these tasks. To avoid these phenomena, various Dimensionality Reduction algorithms are used as a first key step in solutions of these tasks. The algorithms transform the original high-dimensional data into their lower dimensional representations in such a way that the initial task may be reduced to the corresponding task for the constructed lower-dimensional representation of the original dataset. The Dimensionality Reduction problems have different formulations depending on initial Statistical Learning tasks. A new geometrically motivated algorithm that solves various Dimensionality Reduction problems is presented.",Feature Extraction and Selection
16,Bayesian Nonparametric Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Switched Markov Decision Processes,"Markov Decision Processes, Bayesian Nonparametrics, Inverse Reinforcement Learning","In this paper we develop a Bayesian nonparametric Inverse Reinforcement Learning technique for switched Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Similar to switched linear dynamical systems, switched MDP (sMDP)can be used to represent complex behaviors composed of temporal transitions between simpler behaviors each represented by a standard MDP. We use sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process as a nonparametric prior on the sMDP model space, and describe a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to efficiently learn the posterior on the sMDP models given the behavior data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of sMDP models for learning, prediction and  classification of complex agent behaviors in a simulated surveillance scenario.",Machine Learning I
17,State Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning by Eliminating Useless Dimensions,"Reinforcement learning, state abstraction, intelligent agent, complexity reduction","Q-learning and other linear dynamic learning algorithms are subject to Bellmans curse of dimensionality for any realistic learning problem. This paper introduces a framework for satisficing state abstraction one that reduces state dimensionality, improving convergence and reducing computational and memory resources by eliminating useless state dimensions. Statistical parameters that are dependent on the state and Q-values identify the relevance of a given state space to a task space and allow state elements that contribute least to task learning to be discarded. Empirical results of applying state abstraction to a canonical single-agent path planning task and to a more difficult multi-agent foraging problem demonstrate utility of the proposed methods in improving learning convergence and performance in resource-constrained learning problems.",Machine Learning I
18,A knowledge growth and consolidation framework for lifelong machine learning systems,"Lifelong machine learning, oblivion criterion, knowledge topology and acquisition, declarative learning","A more effective vision of machine learning systems entails tools that are able to improve task after task and to reuse the patterns and knowledge that are acquired previously for future tasks. This incremental, long-life view of machine learning goes beyond most of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that learn throw-away models. In this paper we present a long-life knowledge acquisition, evaluation and consolidation framework that is designed to work with any rule-based machine learning or inductive inference engine and integrate it into a long-life learner. In order to do that we work over the graph of working memory rules and introduce several topological metrics over it from which we derive an oblivion criterion to drop useless rules from working memory and a consolidation process to promote the rules to the knowledge base. We evaluate the framework on a series of tasks in a chess rule learning domain.",Machine Learning I
19,LaCova: A Tree-Based Multi-Label Classifier using Label Covariance as Splitting Criterion,"Multi-label learning, Decision Trees, Covariance Matrix, Splitting Criteria","Dealing with multiple labels is a supervised learning problem of increasing importance. Multi-label classifiers face the challenge of exploiting correlations between labels. While in existing work these correlations are often modelled globally, in this paper we use the divide-and-conquer approach of decision trees which enables taking local decisions about how best to model label dependency. The resulting algorithm establishes a tree-based multi-label classifier called LaCova which dynamically interpolates between two well-known baseline methods: Binary Relevance, which assumes all labels independent, and Label Powerset, which learns the joint label distribution. The key idea is a splitting criterion based on the label covariance matrix at that node, which allows us to choose between a horizontal split (branching on a feature) and a vertical split (separating the labels). Empirical results on 12 data sets show strong performance of the proposed method, particularly on data sets with hundreds of labels.",Machine Learning I

We show how to combine exact EFSM inference algorithms~(that always find a solution if it exists) and metaheuristics to derive an efficient combined EFSM learning algorithm. We also present a new exact EFSM inference algorithm based on Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solvers. Experimental results are reported showing that the new combined algorithm significantly outperforms a previously used metaheuristic.,Machine Learning I
21,Human action recognition based on recognition of linear patterns in action bank features using convolutional neural networks,"Human action recognition, action bank features, deep convolutional network","In this paper, we proposed a deep convolutional network architecture for recognizing human actions in videos using action bank features. Action bank features computed against of a predefined set of videos known as an action bank, contain linear patterns representing the similarity of the video against the action bank videos. Due to the independence of the patterns across action bank features, a convolutional neural network with linear masks is considered to capture the local patterns associated with each action. The knowledge gained through training is used to assign an action label to videos during testing. Experiments conducted on UCF50 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing and recognizing these linear local patterns.",Neural Networks I
22,A Cyclic Contrastive Divergence Learning Algorithm for High-order RBMs,"High-order RBMs, Cyclic Contrastive Divergence Learning, Gradient Approximation, Convergence, Upper Bound","The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), a special case of general Boltzmann Machines and a typical Probabilistic Graphical Models, has attracted much attention in recent years due to its powerful ability in extracting features and representing the distribution underlying the training data. A most commonly used algorithm in learning RBMs is called Contrastive Divergence (CD) proposed by Hinton, which starts a Markov chain at a data point and runs the chain for only a few iterations to get a low variance estimator. However, when referring to a high-order RBM, since there are interactions among its visible layers, the gradient approximation via CD learning usually becomes far from the log-likelihood gradient and even may cause CD learning to fall into the infinite loop with high reconstruction error. In this paper, a new algorithm named Cyclic Contrastive Divergence (CCD) is introduced for learning high-order RBMs. Unlike the standard CD algorithm, CCD updates the parameters according to each visible layer in turn, by borrowing the idea of Cyclic Block Coordinate Descent method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed CCD algorithm, regarding to high-order RBMs learning, both algorithms CCD and standard CD are theoretically analyzed, including convergence, estimate upper bound and both biases comparison, from which the superiority of CCD learning is revealed. Experiments of handwritten digit classification task on MNIST dataset are performed. The experimental results show that CCD is more applicable and consistently outperforms the standard CD in both convergent speed and performance.",Neural Networks I

In this paper, we propose an approach for facial expression recognition using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on features generated from depth information only. The Gradient direction information of depth data is used to represent facial information, due its invariance to distance from the sensor. The ability of a convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn local discriminative patterns from data is used to recognize facial expressions from the representation of unregistered facial images. Experiments conducted on EURECOM kinect face dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Neural Networks I
24,Improving Performance on Problems with Few Labelled Data by Reusing Stacked Auto-Encoders,"transfer learning, deep learning, artificial neural networks","Deep architectures have been used in transfer learning applications, with the aim of improving the performance of networks designed for a given problem by reusing knowledge from another problem. In this work we addressed the transfer of knowledge between deep networks used as classifiers of digit and shape images, considering cases where only the set of class labels, or only the data distribution, changed from source to target problem. Our main goal was to study how the performance of knowledge transfer between such problems would be affected by varying the number of layers being retrained and the amount of data used in that retraining. Generally, reusing networks trained for a different label set led to better results than reusing networks trained for a different data distribution. In particular, reusing for less classes a network trained for more classes was beneficial for virtually any amount of training data. In all cases, retraining only one layer to save time consistently led to poorer performance. The results obtained when retraining for upright digits a network trained for rotated digits raise the hypothesis that transfer learning could be used to better deal with image classification problems in which only a small amount of labelled data is available for training.",Neural Networks I
25,An Analysis of Instance Selection for Neural Networks to Improve Training Speed,"instance selection, neural networks, training speed","Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is relatively slow compared to many other machine learning algorithms.  In this study, we focus on instance selection to improve training speed.  We first evaluate the effectiveness of instance selection algorithms for k-nearest neighbor algorithms with ANN.  We then analyze factors in accuracy distance from decision boundary, dense regions, and class distributions, and propose new instance selection algorithms.  We discuss the tradeoff between accuracy and training speed, and introduce a measure for the tradeoff.  Our empirical results on real data sets indicate that our proposed RDI is more effective with ANN.",Neural Networks I
26,Human action recognition based on MOCAP information using convolution neural networks,"convolutional neural networks (CNN), motion capture (MOCAP)","Human action recognition is an important component in semantic analysis of human behavior. In this paper, we propose an approach for human action recognition based on motion capture (MOCAP) information using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Distance based metrics computed from MOCAP information of only three human joints are used in the computation of features. The range and temporal variation of these distance metrics are considered in the design of features which are discriminative for action recognition. A convolutional neural network capable of recognizing local patterns is used to identify human actions from the temporal variation of these features, which are distorted due to the inconsistency in the execution of actions across observations and subjects. Experiments conducted on Berkeley MHAD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Neural Network II

We adopted a fast unsupervised method for learning continuous vector representations of words, and used these representations along with language independent features to develop a NER system. We evaluated our system for the highly inflectional Turkish and Czech languages and obtained better F-score performances than the previously published results for these languages. We improved the state-of-the-art F-score by 2.26% for Turkish and 1.53% for Czech. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art systems developed for these languages, our system does not make use of any language dependent features. Therefore, we believe it can easily be applied to other morphologically rich languages.",Neural Network II

The height of the foot above the ground is considered as features to discriminate human locomotion activities. The periodic nature of actions in these activities is exploited to generate the training cases from a single instance using a sliding window. Also, the capability of a convolutional neural network to learn local visual patterns is exploited for human activity recognition.

In the first method, we add side information in the form of pairwise constraints to its objective function, and in the second, we add a temporal search to its framework. We also extend both methods by propagating the constraints throughout the whole similarity matrix. In order to validate the advantage of the proposed semi-supervised methods to temporal clustering, we evaluate them in comparison to their original versions as well as another semi-supervised temporal cluster on three temporal datasets. The results show that the proposed methods are competitive and provide good improvement over the unsupervised approaches.",Semi-Supervised Learning
32,Learning to Rank with Only Positive Examples,"Information Need Modeling, Positive Unlabeled Learning, Transductive Learning, Search by Multiple Examples","A key to successfully retrieve relevant documents lies in how users express their information needs using keywords as queries.  However, for many users, it is difficult for them to use keywords to express their information needs. Search-By-Multiple-Examples (SBME), a promising method for overcoming this problem, allows users to specify their information needs as a set of relevant documents rather than as a set of keywords. In this study, we propose a Transductive Positive Unlabeled learning (TPU learning) based framework for document ranking The framework consists of two steps: 1) identifying potential relevant documents to reduce the searching space from the entire data collection to a smaller dataset, and 2) adopting TPU learning methods to re-rank the searching space by treating the relevant documents from a user as positive examples P and the documents in the searching space as unlabeled data U. Using MAP and p@k, we evaluate two state-of-the-art PU learning algorithms and the Rocchio classifier (Rc) for document ranking in the proposed framework with different sizes of P to simulate users online search behaviors. We then adopt the idea of ensemble learning to combine Rc with the two state-of-the-art PU learning algorithms respectively. Experiments conducted on two real datasets show that the ensemble learning based methods lead to significant improvement in performance.",Semi-Supervised Learning

These equations are a discrete analogue of well known geometric PDEs, which are widely used in image processing. While the p-Laplacian on graphs was intensively used in data classification, few works relate to the eikonal equation for data classification. The methods are illustrated through semi-supervised classification tasks on databases, where we compare the two algorithms. The results show that these methods perform well regarding the state-of-the-art and are applicable to the task of semi-supervised classification.",Semi-Supervised Learning
34,Post-Processing Association Rules using Networks and Transductive Learning,"Networks, Association Rules, Pruning, Post-Processing, Label Propagation","Association is widely used to find relations among items in a given database. However, finding the interesting patterns is a challenging task due to the large number of rules that are generated. Traditionally, this task is done by post-processing approaches that explore and direct the user to the interesting rules of the domain. Some of these approaches use the user's knowledge to guide the exploration according to what is defined (thought) as interesting by the user. However, this definition is done before the process starts. Therefore, the user must know what may be and what may not be interesting to him/her. This work proposes a general association rule post-processing approach that extracts the user's knowledge during the post-processing phase. That way, the user does not need to have a prior knowledge in the database. For that, the proposed approach models the association rules in a network, uses its measures to suggest rules to be classified by the user and, then, propagates these classifications to the entire network using transductive learning algorithms. Therefore, this approach treats the post-processing problem as a classification task. Experiments were carried out to demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the number of rules to be explored by the user and directs him/her to the potentially interesting rules of the domain.",Semi-Supervised Learning

We characterize the joint distribution of the response and covariates via a Stick-Breaking Prior. This leads to, in the various cases, nonparametric models for an infinite mixture of Inverse Gaussian, Multinomial Probit and Exponential Regression. Estimates of the localized mean function which maps the covariates to the response are presented. We prove the weak consistency for the posterior distribution of the Exponential model (SB-EX) and then propose mean field variational inference algorithms for the Inverse Gaussian, Multinomial Probit and Exponential Regression. Finally, we demonstrate their superior accuracy in comparison to several other regression models such as, Gaussian Process Regression, Dirichlet Process Regression, etc.",Semi-Supervised Learning
36,Varying Coefficient Models for Analyzing the Effects of Risk Factors on Pregnant Women's Blood Pressure,"Varying Coefficient Model, longitudinal data, gestational hypertension","In the study of gestational hypertension, most of studies focused on whether a risk factor is associated with gestational hypertension. However, according to the clinical experience, it is important to know the effects of risk factors on women's blood pressure during pregnancy. Thus, we examined the effects of known risk factors (age, hematocrit, etc.) over gestational age. We also examined whether the effects of known risk factors are different between gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group. These were studied in 412 pregnant women including 1874 clinical follow-up records. On the longitudinal clinical data of pregnant women, varying coefficient models were applied to study the effects of known risk factors over gestational age. The results showed that the effects of known risk factors varied with gestational age, and the changing processes of known risk factors over gestational age were different between gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group. In final, we used the relative error as the criterion to assess the accuracy of the estimated varying coefficient model. The relative errors for total clinical data, gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group were 13.3%, 8.1% and 14.3%, respectively.",Medicine and Bioinformatics
37,Learning Score Systems for Patient Mortality Prediction in Intensive Care Units via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit,"logistic regression, Intensive care units, mortality rate prediction, score systems, orthogonal matching pursuit","The problem of predicting outcome of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is of great importance in critical care medicine, and has wide implications for quality control in ICUs. A dominant approach to this problem has been to use an ICU score system such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) system and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) system, to compute a certain severity score for a patient from a set of clinical observations, and apply a logistic regression model on this score to obtain an estimate of the probability of mortality for the patient, owing to their simplicity, these methods are widely used by clinicians. However, existing ICU score systems, which are built from a fixed set of patient data, often perform poorly when applied to a patient population with different characteristics, also, with changes in patient characteristics, a score system built from a given patient data set becomes suboptimal over time. Moreover, most of these score systems are built using semi-automated procedures, making it difficult to adapt them to a new patient population. Thus there is a huge need for adaptive methods that can automatically learn predictive models from a given set of patient data. Indeed, there has been much work in recent years on applying various machine learning methods to this problem, however these methods learn different representations from the score systems preferred by clinicians. In this work, we develop a machine learning method based on orthogonal matching pursuit that automatically learns a score system type model, which enjoys the benefits of both worlds: like other machine learning methods, it is adaptive, like standard score systems, it uses a representation that is easy for clinicians to understand. Experiments on real-world patient data sets show that our method outperforms standard ICU score systems, and performs at least as well as other machine learning methods for this problem.",Medicine and Bioinformatics

Hemiplegic gait is characterized by an affected and unaffected leg, which can be quantified by the measurement of a force plate. The characteristic features of the force plate recording for gait consist of a two local maxima that represent the braking and push off phase of stance and their associated parameters. The quantified features of a hemiplegic pair of affected and unaffected force plate recordings are intuitively disparate. Logistic regression achieves 100% classification between an affected and unaffected hemiplegic leg pair based on the feature set of the force plate data.",Medicine and Bioinformatics

In this work, we take Bayesian networks built by specialists and show that minor perturbations to this original network can yield better classifiers with a very small computational cost, while maintaining most of the interpretability of the original network.",Medicine and Bioinformatics
40,Time Warping Symbolic Aggregation Approximation with Bag-of-Patterns Representation for Time Series Classification,"Time series analysis, Correlation, Standards, Error analysis, Vectors, Electrocardiography, Training","Standard Symbolic Aggregation approXimation (SAX) is at the core of many effective time series data mining algorithms. Its combination with Bag-of-Patterns has become the standard approach with bleeding-edge performance on standard datasets. However, standard SAX with BoP representation might neglect the internal temporal correlation embedded in the data. In this paper, we proposed time warping SAX, which extends the standard SAX methods with time delay embedding vector approaches by considering the temporal correlations. We test time warping SAX with BoP representation on 12 benchmark dataset from UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering Page and on 9 of them time warping SAX overtakes the state-of-th-eart performance of standard SAX. To validate our methods in real world applications, a new dataset of vital signs collected from the patients who may require blood transfusion (pRBC) in the next 6 hours are tested. All the results demonstrate that by considering the temporal internal correlation, our time warping SAX with BoP representations could significantly enhance the representation power.",Medicine and Bioinformatics

42,Sequential Logistic Principal Component Analysis (SLPCA): Dimensional Reduction in Streaming Multivariate Binary-State System,"energy end-use model, dimensional reduction, sequential optimization","Sequential or online dimensional reduction is of interests due to the explosion of streaming data based applications and the requirement of adaptive statistical modeling, in many emerging fields, such as the modeling of energy end-use profile. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is the classical way of dimensional reduction. However, traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based PCA fails to model data which largely deviates from Gaussian distribution. The Bregman Divergence was recently introduced to achieve a generalized PCA framework. If the random variables under dimensional reduction follow Bernoulli distribution, which occurs in many emerging fields, the generalized PCA is called Logistic PCA (LPCA). In this paper, we extend the batch LPCA to a sequential version (i.e. SLPCA), based on the sequential convex optimization theory. The convergence property of this algorithm is discussed compared to the batch version of LPCA (i.e. BLPCA), as well as its performance in reducing the dimension for multivariate binary-state systems. Its application in building energy end-use profile modeling is also investigated.",Real-time Systems and Industry
43,Using k-Nearest Neighbor and Speaker Ranking for Phoneme Prediction,"speech recognition, phoneme, k-Nearest Neighbor, classification, phoneme prediction, template matching","Speech recognition systems are either based on parametric approach or non-parametric approach. Parametric based system such as HMMs have been the dominant technology for speech recognition in the past decade. Despite a lot of advancements and enhancements in the design of these systems:  key problems such as long term temporal dependence, etc. has not yet been solved. Recently due to availability of large amount of data and inexpensive computing resources (processing power and memory) parametric based approach to solve speech recognition and classification task is becoming popular and feasible. The key advantage of parametric based approach is that all the information from the training data is retained as we dont approximate our data with specific statistical models resulting in more speaker specific information. In this paper we propose a kNN phoneme prediction scheme using speaker ranking vector. Speaker ranking vector is generated by finding the similarity of the given TEST speaker with the training data using kNN. The results were compared with nearest neighbor and kNN majority voting approach. Our proposed scheme gives a better prediction accuracy as compare with nearest neighbor and kNN majority voting scheme. This approach can help speech recognizer to customize on the fly for a given talker and customize training data on the basis of similarity measure.",Real-time Systems and Industry

In this paper we present a general team recommendation framework for finding best deal teams to pursue such engagement opportunities. Little previous work on team recommendation considers both individual and team-level features at the same time.  Our proposed framework can take into account diverse individual and team features, and accommodate various cost or feature functions. We introduce a team quality metric based on a weighted linear combination of these features, the weights of which are learned using a machine learning approach by leveraging historical project outcomes. A combinatorial optimization algorithm is finally applied to search the possible solution space for the approximate best team. We report a preliminary evaluation of our framework by applying it to a real-world data from strategic outsourcing businesses at a large IT service company.

It computes the ideal mapping of the domain of observations, using either discrete or continuous distributions of values (1). The SOM benefits from the coupling with a genetic algorithm (GA). GAs are optimization algorithms that allow the user to evolve a solution from a distribution of potential solutions (2). The fittest candidates survive and participate in the production of future generations of new solutions. The fusion of these two techniques results in a dynamic algorithm that maps a diverse input plane in an optimizing fashion, striving towards perfection while learning from mistakes.

The voiceprint is modelled as sub-MFCCs matrix with the first d number of MFCCs. We model the relationship through information theory and formulate it as the mutual information maximization problem subject to the probabilities constraint. The solution of this optimization problem provides the optimal number of MFCCs, which yields the highest classification accuracy of the voice discrimination, together with a confidence level. This study is dictated by the need to understand the use of MFCCs, which have proliferated since its invention to discriminate voice. We evaluate our model by comparing the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) results of usual multi-class classifier, the Supervised Learning Gaussian Mixture Model (SLGMM), with a set of spoken words and solo acapella singings. The experimental results show that our model is a more comprehensive feature selection criteria for the MFCCs than the de-facto technique, LOOCV.",Information Retrieval I

48,Topic Detection in Instant Messages,"Topic detection, Instant message, PLSA, Multilingual, Useless words","In the past few years, instant messaging (IM) has been widely used in daily communication. However, due to the dispersion of topics and meaningless chatting, online IM groups are filled with useless messages. In order to help IM users capture what the IM group is talking about without spending a long time in reading all the messages, topic discovery in instant messages becomes a significant but challenging research task. In this paper, we propose a new method for topic detection in instant messages, which is applicable for the case where 1) useless terms keep emerging, 2) the instant messages are very short, and 3) multiple languages are used. The basic step is to treat each message in an online group discussion as a data item in message stream, and then apply PLSA to the collected instant messages. One strategy is designed to segment multilingual message without utilizing machine translation and remove the useless words that keep emerging. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the real-world QQ group data to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Information Retrieval I

Integrative complexity (IC) is usually determined from text through manual scoring, which is time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Consequently, there is a demand for automating the scoring, which could significantly reduce the time, expense and cognitive resources spent in the process. Any algorithm that could achieve the above with a reasonable accuracy could assist in the development of intervention systems for reducing the potential for aggression, systems for recruitment processes and even training personnel for improving group disparity in the corporate world. In this study we used machine learning to predict IC levels from text. We achieved over 78% accuracy in a three way classification.",Information Retrieval I

Twitter has become a dependable microblogging tool for real time information dissemination and newsworthy events broadcast. Its users sometimes break news on the network faster than traditional newsagents due to their presence at on-going real life events at all times. Different topic detection methods are currently used to match Twitter posts to real life news of mainstream media. In this paper, we analyse events highlights in the English FA Cup final 2012 played between Chelsea FC and Liverpool FC using our novel methodology named TRCM. Our system was able to detect all goals scored in the game, 1 of the 3 bookings and 3 of the four substitutions. Our system also detected other events like free kicks, goal saves and misses  as well as ball clearances and off-side positions that occurred during the match duration.

51,Using Spectral Features to Improve Sentiment Analysis,"feature discovery, spectral learning, discrete Fourier, sentiment analysis","A common approach to sentiment classification is to identify a set of sentiment-carrying words and then to use machine learning to build a classifier that can classify sentiment based on the presence/absence of those words. In this paper, we propose a Fourier-based extension of this approach. Specifically, we introduce a spectral learning algorithm  that implicitly identifies sentiment-carrying words and higher-order functions of those words as it learns to assign real-valued sentiment scores to documents. The spectral learner extends the word presence model by applying Boolean logic operators (AND, OR, and XOR) to the word presence features to identify useful higher-order features. These spectral features can be used in other learning algorithms, and we show how the performance of other learning algorithms can be improved by these features. Finally, we consider the problem of determining which of a pair of reviews expresses more positive overall sentiment, and we show that the spectral learner can identify very small distinctions in sentiment with better-than-random accuracy, while larger distinctions can be correctly identified with high accuracy.",Information Retrieval II
52,Recommendation Systems for Markets with Two Sided Preferences,"Recommender systems, Two-sided markets","In recent times we have witnessed the emergence of large online markets with two-sided preferences that are responsible for businesses worth billions of dollars. Recommendation systems are critical components of such markets. It is to be noted that the matching in such a market depends on the preferences of both sides, consequently, the construction of a recommendation system for such a market calls for consideration of preferences of both sides. The online dating market, and the online freelancer market are examples of markets with two-sided preferences. Past studies on building recommendation systems for such markets, however, lacks a systematic approach. We observe that constructing recommendation systems for markets with two-sided preferences can be posed as an Area Under the receiver operator Curve(AUC) optimization problem. Generalized linear regression models are popular methods of constructing ranking or recommendation systems in such markets on account of their ability to be learned easily from big data, and their computational simplicity on engineering platforms. We conjecture that it is more likely for matching in such markets to be a complex combination of preferences of both sides. To account for this, we introduce a novel two-level model for optimizing the AUC of matching in such markets. For both synthetic and real data we show that the two-level model algorithm has a better AUC performance than the direct application of a generalized linear model such as $L_{1}$ logistic regression or an ensemble method such as random forest algorithm. We provide a theoretical justification of AUC optimality of two-level model and pose a theoretical problem for a more general result. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of recommendation systems using AUC optimization in markets with two-sided preferences.",Information Retrieval II

However, it is usually treated using methods that do not take into account the real financial costs associated with the lending business. In this paper, we propose a new example-dependent cost matrix for credit scoring. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm that introduces the example-dependent costs into a logistic regression. Using two publicly available datasets, we compare our proposed method against state-of-the-art example-dependent cost-sensitive algorithms. The results highlight the importance of using real financial costs. Moreover, by using the proposed cost-sensitive logistic regression, significant improvements are made in the sense of higher savings.",Science and Industry

An algorithm is presented that uses a single instance of an underlying single-objective optimization algorithm to optimize different objectives at different iterations and restarts the optimization algorithm between optimizing different objectives. This algorithm has the expected running time of at most 4 K min_O T_O until an optimum of the target objective is found, where T_O is the expected running time of the underlying optimization algorithm to find an optimum of the target objective by optimizing the objective O. An impact of not using restarts between iterations is also discussed.",Machine Learning II
58,Adding Diversity to Rank Examples in Anytime Nearest Neighbor Classification,"Anytime Algorithm, Nearest Neighbor, Classification, Data Stream","Data streams are ubiquitous in virtually every application domain. However, a property that is common to various domains and is frequently disregarded is the very high fluctuating data rates, in which the events do not occur with a fixed frequency. The classical learning algorithms do not seem to be adequate in such a scenario. In contrast, anytime classification provides a very convenient approach for this situation. In summary, an anytime classifier can be interrupted at any time before its completion and still be able to provide an intermediate classification. The popular k-nearest neighbor classifier can be easily made anytime by introducing a ranking of the training examples. In this paper, we show how the current state-of-the-art k-NN anytime classifier can be made more accurate by introducing diversity in the training set ranking. Our results show that, with this simple modification, the performance of the anytime version of the k-NN algorithm is consistently improved for a large number of datasets.",Machine Learning II

In this paper we show that the plurality rule is sub-optimal when the number of labels is large and the number of examples is small. We propose a simple k-NN rule that takes into account the labels of all of the neighbors, rather than just the most common label.

61,Protein Conformation Motion Modeling using sep-CMA-ES,"mass transfer, cma-es, protein conformation, conformation motion","The problem of protein conformation motion modeling is an open problem in the structural computational biology. It is difficult to solve it using methods of molecular dynamics or quantum physics because these methods deal with time intervals of nanoseconds or microseconds, while conformation motions take time of millisecond order. In addition, these methods cannot take external forces into consideration. To cope with these problems, numerous approximated and coarse-grained methods are developed, which use ideas from geometry and motion planning.We present a new coarse-grained method of modeling the protein motion between two given conformations. The method is based on optimization of a cost function similar to the one in the Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem. The optimization is performed using sep-CMA-ES, which makes the running time of an iteration linear in the number of amino acids in a protein. The proposed method is compared with some of the existing methods on several molecules. It is shown that the results of the proposed method are more accurate than of the other methods.","Medicine, Science and Music"

To illustrate our method, we take 26 audio recordings of a capella solo vocal music from two different professional singers and we visualise the performance style of each vocalist in a two dimensional space of pitch and dynamics. We use our own novel modification of a trajectory clustering algorithm called TRACLUS to generate four representative paths, called trajectories, in that two dimensional space.  Each trajectory represents the characteristic style of a vocalist during one of four common musical events: (1) Crescendo, (2) Diminuendo, (3) Ascending Pitches and (4) Descending Pitches. The unique shapes of these trajectories characterize the singing style of each vocalist with respect to each of these events. We present the details of our modified version of the TRACULUS algorithm and demonstrate graphically how the plots produced indicate distinct stylistic differences betweens singers. Potential applications for this method include: (a) automatic identification of singers and automatic classification of singing styles and (b) automatic retargeting of performance style to add human expression to computer generated vocal performances and allow singing synthesisers to imitate the styles of specific famous professional vocalists.","Medicine, Science and Music"

However, most of the existing matrix completion methods only provide a point estimate of missing entries, and do not characterize uncertainties of the predictions. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization (BHPMF) model to 1) incorporate hierarchical side information, and 2) provide uncertainty quantified predictions. The former yields significant performance improvements in the problem of plant trait prediction, a key problem in ecology, by leveraging the taxonomic hierarchy in the plant kingdom. The latter is helpful in identifying predictions of low confidence which can in turn be used to guide field work for data collection efforts. A Gibbs sampler is designed for inference in the model. Further, we propose a multiple inheritance BHPMF (MI-BHPMF) which can work with a general directed acyclic graph (DAG) structured hierarchy, rather than a tree. We present comprehensive experimental results on the problem of plant trait prediction using the largest database of plant traits, where BHPMF shows strong empirical performance in uncertainty quantified trait prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art based on point estimates. Further, we show that BHPMF is more accurate when it is confident, whereas the error is high when the uncertainty is high.","Medicine, Science and Music"

In this paper, we apply the machine learning technique random forest to a heterogeneous dataset consisting of so-called ""load spectrum"" data resulting from transforming stress-time functions to frequency distributions. In Fatigue Analysis this is the state-of-the-art data employed for calculating the fatigue life of components. We (i) study the usability of random forests modeled on this kind of data to distinguish between faulty and non-faulty vehicles, and (ii) address the problem of selecting a small number of relevant variables in order to further decrease the misclassification rate and, even more important from our engineering point of view, to identify failure related variables. As our data contains just very few samples of faulty compared to non-faulty vehicles, we furthermore present a framework for tuning the random forest to handle this class imbalance. We demonstrate experimentally for failures of the hybrid car battery that using random forests for variable selection and classification of load spectrum data achieves promising classification performance and enables engineers to identify possible relationships between loads and failures of hybrid components.",Machine Learning for Predictive Models I

Our results are based on nine pilot sessions held in a local high school where we recorded features related to student engagement while consuming educational content. We label the collected data as Engaged or NotEngaged while observing videos of the students and their screens. Based on the collected data, perceptual user features (e.g., body posture, facial points, and gaze) are extracted. We use feature selection and classification methods to produce classifiers that can detect whether a student is engaged or not. Accuracies of up to 85-95% are achieved on the collected dataset.

78,Automatically filtering irrelevant words for applications in language acquisition,educational data mining; English as a foreign language; natural language processing for education,"Building one's vocabulary in a language is an important component of language acquisition. Children learn their native language by being immersed in the language that is used in their environment. However, in second language acquisition, learners are often exposed to vocabulary that is selected by others specifically to aid language acquisition such as textbooks and word-lists. In this paper, we are presenting a machine learning based method for automatically selecting words that are relevant to the language acquisition task. The word relevancy is determined using data collected from 30 practicing English as a Second Language teachers for this purpose. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by using words from two major corpora, although in practice any corpora such as Google Books corpus can be utilized.",Machine Learning Applications in Education II
79,A Clustering-based Grouping Model for Enhanceing Collaborative Learning,"collaborative learning, balanced K-means, group diversity","Group work is widely used in tertiary institutions due to the considerable advantages of collaborative learning. Previous studies indicated that the group diversity had positive influence on the group work achievement. Therefore, how to achieve diversity within a group effectively and automatically is an interesting question. In this paper we propose a novel clustering-based grouping model. The proposed technique first employs balanced K-means algorithm to divide the students into several size-balanced clusters, such that the students within the same cluster are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other clusters, then adopts one-sample-each-cluster strategy to construct the groups1. We evaluated the proposed technique based on two small-scale case studies. The result observed may indicate that the clustering-based grouping model is feasible and effective.",Machine Learning Applications in Education II

83,TSD: Detecting Sybil Accounts in Twitter,"Spamdexing, Social networks, Sybil account, Fake user accounts, Twitter, Web spam, Content spam","Fake identities and user accounts (also called ""Sybils"") in online communities represent today a treasure for adversaries to spread fake product reviews, malware and spam on social networks, and Astroturf political campaigns. State-of-the-art in the defense mechanisms includes Automated Turing Tests (ATTs such as CAPTCHAs) and graph-based Sybil detectors. Sybil detectors in social networks leverage the assumption that Sybils will find it hard to befriend real users which leads to Sybils being connected to each other forming strongly connected sub graphs that can be detected using graph theory. However, the large majority of Sybils are in fact successful in integrating themselves into real user communities (such as the case in Twitter and Facebook). In this paper, we first study and compare the current detection mechanisms of Sybil accounts. We also explore various types of Twitter Sybil accounts detection features with the objective of building an effective and practical classifier. In order to build and evaluate our classifier, we collect and manually label a dataset of twitter accounts, including human users, bots, and hybrid (i.e., Tweets are posted by both human and bots). We believe this Twitter Sybils corpus will help researchers in conducting sound measurement studies. We also develop a browser plug-in (that we call Twitter Sybils Detector or TSD for short) that utilizes our classifier and warns the user about possible Sybil accounts before accessing them, upon clicking on a Twitter account.",Machine Learning in Information and System Security Issues

In the current study, a total number of 500 fingerprints from 10 fingers of 50 Turkish citizens were collected to estimate the ages of the participants from their fingerprints. Their full fingerprints were first taken and then the fingerprints were converted to binary images. Then, a matrix of 1153600 was achieved from the binary images. Based on these distances, the fingerprint data were classified using KNN classification algorithm. An average success rate of 93.3% was obtained in males aged between 18-24 while 83.0% average success rate was obtained in females in the same age group. The initial results have shown that the proposed new method is very successful in estimating ages from fingerprints.

88,Transient Characteristics of DC-DC Converter with PID Parameters Selection and Neural Network Control,"neural network, dc-dc converter, PID control","This paper presents a neural network based PID parameter selection control to improve the transient response of dc-dc converters. In the conventional PID control, parameters of it such as proportional, integral, and differential coefficients are selected as fixed parameters to regulate both transient and steady-state characteristics simultaneously as much as possible. The parameter setting of PID control is not optimal for the improvement of transient-state characteristics since the setting needs to satisfy stable steady-state characteristics. Therefore, the parameter selection for different states is widely applicable from the point of view of the improvement of transient response. In this study, we present a novel parameter selection method for PID control based on the load change prediction of neural network to improve the transient response of dc-dc converter. In the presented method, suitable PID parameters are selected with neural network. This neural network is trained to predict the load change from the output voltage of dc-dc converter in advance. From the predicted result of neural network, PID parameters are changed to optimal ones after the load change occurs. Additionally, the reference modification with another neural network, which is trained to modify the reference value of PID control, is also adopted simultaneously to obtain more effective improvement of transient response. From evaluation results, we confirm that our presented method contributes to obtain an effective improvement of the transient response compared to the conventional PID control.",Machine Learning in Energy Applications

An ensemble regression model consists of a group of homogeneous regressors with varying parameters, e.g. Linear regression models with different ridge regularization parameters. The first ensemble method called ""recent leader"" picks the individual regressor with least mean square error over recent data. The second model called ""exponentially weighted ensemble"" combines individual regressors in a linear fashion with weights of constituent models decaying exponentially with the mean square error over past predictions. These two methods were tested with linear regression, support vector regression, decision trees and Gaussian processes. Exponentially weighted ensemble with support vector regression had the best performance.",Machine Learning in Energy Applications
90,Improved Selection of Auxiliary Objectives Using Reinforcement Learning in Non-stationary Environment,"non-stationary, objective selection, multiobjectivization, auxiliary objectives, ea+rl, reinforcement learning","Efficiency of evolutionary algorithms can be increased by using auxiliary objectives. The method which is called EA+RL is considered. In this method a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is used to select objectives in evolutionary algorithms (EA) during optimization. In earlier studies, reinforcement learning algorithms for stationary environments were used in the EA+RL method. However, if behavior of auxiliary objectives change during the optimization process, it can be better to use reinforcement learning algorithms which are specially developed for non-stationary environments. In our previous work we proposed a new reinforcement learning algorithm to be used in the EA+RL method. In this work we propose an improved version of that algorithm. The new algorithm is applied to a non-stationary problem and compared with the methods which were used in other studies. It is shown that the proposed method achieves optimal value more often and obtains higher values of the target objective than the other algorithms","Machine Learning Algorithms, Systems and Applications"
91,A New Algorithm for Adaptive Online Selection of Auxiliary Objectives,"parameter control, reinforcement learning, multi-objectivization, evolutionary algorithms","Consider optimization problems, where a target objective should be optimized. Some auxiliary objectives can be used to obtain the optimum of the target objective in less number of objective evaluations. We call such auxiliary objective a supporting one. Usually there is no prior knowledge about properties of auxiliary objectives, some objectives can be obstructive as well. What is more, an auxiliary objective can be both supporting and obstructive at different stages of the target objective optimization. Thus, an adaptive online method of objective selection is needed. Earlier, we proposed a method for doing that, which is based on reinforcement learning. In this paper, a new algorithm for adaptive online selection of optimization objectives is proposed. The algorithm meets the interface of a reinforcement learning agent, so it can be fit into the previously proposed framework. The new algorithm is applied for solving some benchmark problems with single-objective evolutionary algorithms. Specifically, Leading Ones with OneMax auxiliary objective is considered, as well as the MH-IFF problem. Experimental results are presented. The proposed algorithm outperforms Q-learning and random objective selection on the considered problems.","Machine Learning Algorithms, Systems and Applications"
92,Iterative Hard Thresholding for Keyword Extraction from Large Text Corpora,"text analysis,information retrieval,iterative methods,statistical analysis","To better understand and analyze text corpora, such as the news, it is often useful to extract keywords that are meaningfully associated with a given topic. A corpus of documents labeled by their topic can be used to approach this as a learning problem. We consider this problem through the lens of statistical text analysis, using bag-of-words frequencies as features for a sparse linear model. We demonstrate, through numerical experiments, that iterative hard thresholding (IHT) is a practical and effective algorithm for keyword-extraction from large text corpora. In fact, our implementation of IHT can quickly analyze more than 800,000 documents, returning keywords comparable to algorithms solving a Lasso problem-formulation, with significantly less computation time. Further, we generalize the analysis of the IHT algorithm to show that it is stable for rank deficient matrices, as those arising from our bag-of-words model often are.","Machine Learning Algorithms, Systems and Applications"
93,A Novel Bayesian Network Based Scheme for Finding the Optimal Solution to Stochastic Online Equi-partitioning Problems,"Bayes methods,Partitioning algorithms,Meteorology,Noise,Stochastic processes,Convergence,Probabilistic logic","A number of intriguing decision scenarios, such as order picking, revolve around partitioning a collection of objects so as to optimize some application specific objective function. In its general form, this problem is referred to as the Object Partitioning Problem (OOP), known to be NP-hard. We here consider a variant of OPP, namely the Stochastic Online Equi-Partitioning Problem (SO-EPP). In SO-EPP, objects arrive sequentially, in pairs. The relationship between the arriving object pairs is stochastic: They belong to the same partition with probability p. From a history of object arrivals, the goal is to predict which objects will appear together in future arrivals. As an additional complication, the partitions of related objects are required to be of equal cardinality. The decision maker, however, is not informed about the true relation between the objects, he is merely observing the stream of object pairs, and has to predict future behavior. Inferring the correct partitioning from historical behavior is thus a significant challenge, which becomes even more difficult when p is unknown. Previously, only heuristic sub-optimal solution strategies have been proposed for SO-EPP. In this paper, we propose the first it optimal solution strategy. In brief, the scheme that we propose, BN-EPP, is founded on a Bayesian Network representation of SO-EPP problems. Based on probabilistic reasoning we are not only able to infer the correct object partitioning with optimal accuracy. We are also able to simultaneously infer p, allowing us to accelerate learning as object pairs arrive. Being optimal, BN-EPP provides superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art solution schemes. BN-EPP is also highly flexible, being capable of encoding object partitioning constraints. Finally, BN-EPP is parameter free - its performance does not rely on fine tuning any parameters. As a result of these advantages, BN-EPP opens up for significantly improved performance for OOP based applications.","Machine Learning Algorithms, Systems and Applications"

In this study, a dataset was formed by taking the index finger, ring finger, height and ages of 67 Turkish men and 56 Turkish women. The dataset was used for identifying the sex of the person and thus, information that could reveal the identity of the information was obtained. LAD Tree algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm, KNN algorithm and C4.5 algorithm were tried on the datasets. C4.5 algorithm had the highest rate of success in determining sex with a rate of 93%. Therefore, automatic sex classification was made using C4.5 algorithm. Studies revealed that 2D:4D ratio varies in different sexes and races. Moving from these studies, sex was determined from the ratio of index finger to ring finger. When compared with the existing studies in the literature on different races, it was proved that race also can be determined. It was found that left hand provided higher success in finger ratio use in identifying sex compared to the right hand.","Machine Learning Algorithms, Systems and Applications"
95,Dynamic Inclusion of New Event Types in Visual Inspection using Evolving Classifiers,"expected change in classifier's accuracy, visual inspection, new event types, integration of new classes on-the-fly, evolving (fuzzy) classifiers","In this paper, we are dealing with the automatic inclusion of new event types in visual inspection systems. Within the context of image classification for recognizing ""OK"" and ""not OK"" parts, a certain event can be directly associated with a class, as events are usually independent and disjoint from each other. In this sense, we are dealing with the problem of integrating a new class into the image classifier on-the-fly, once specified on-line by an operator. We are using evolving fuzzy classifiers (EFC), which are relying on fuzzy rule bases and are able to adapt their structure and update their parameters in incremental manner. The novel methodological aspects lie (1.) in appropriate structural changes in the EFC whenever a new class appears and (2.) in the estimation of the expected change in classifier accuracy on the older classes seen before, which is based on an analysis of the expected change in the classifier's decision boundaries. The second point is an important aspect for operators, as they are already familiar to work with established classifiers that have some accuracy in classification. The new concepts will be evaluated on a real-world visual inspection scenario, where the main tasks is to classify event types which may occur on micro-fluidic chips and may lead to the deterioration of their quality.",Adaptive Data-Driven Modeling in Dynamic Environments and On-line Processes

Here, the user names a desired effect (e.g. Make the sound ""warm"") and teaches the tool (e.g. An equalizer) what settings make the sound embody the term. Social EQ typically requires 25 ratings to properly personalize the equalization settings. In this paper, we present three methods to improve the speed of generating personalized items (audio settings) so users can be provided personalized EQ curves after rating a much smaller number of examples. These methods can be adapted to any situation where collaborative filtering is desirable, the end products created for users are unique and comparable to each other, but prior users did not rate the same set of examples as the current user.

The former technique tends to be costly to apply, while the latter is often not as accurate as its supervised counterpart. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach that automatically labels the semantic slots in a set of training data and aims to strike a balance between the dependence on labelled data and prediction accuracy. The essence of our algorithm is to cluster clauses based on a similarity function that combines lexical and semantic information. We present experiments that compare different similarity functions for both our semi-supervised setting and a fully unsupervised baseline. While semi-supervised learning expectedly outperforms unsupervised learning, our results show that this effect can be observed based on very few training data instances and that increasing the size of the training data does not lead to better performance, and that lexical and semantic information contribute differently in different domains so that clustering based on both types of information offers the best generalisation.",Adaptive Data-Driven Modeling in Dynamic Environments and On-line Processes

In the absence of one modality or presence of a noisy modality, other modalities can benefit precision of systems. HCI systems can also benefit from these multimodal communication models for different machine learning tasks. The provision of multiple modalities is motivated by usability, presence of noise in one modality and non-universality of a single modality. Combining multimodal information introduces new challenges to machine learning such as designing fusion classifiers.

Previous CAD models have relied on radiologist-delineated contours to extract image features and classify lung nodules into semantic ratings. Manually creating these contours can be time-consuming and expensive. This paper proposes a different CAD system based on multiple machine-sourced segmentations that can provide semantic ratings at least as accurate as a panel of experts in order to aid in the diagnostic process. However, the mass production of machine-sourced segmentations may sometimes produce unwanted noise. Therefore, we propose to filter out the bad segmentations by applying an outlier detection algorithm that identifies segmentations that are far away from the majority of the segmentations. Our results are compared to a CAD system based on expert-sourced contours and a reference truth generated by radiologists' semantic ratings. Using the Lung Image Database Consortium dataset, we show that machine-sourced segmentations provide predictions at least as good as expert-sourced segmentations and how outlier removal affects mostly shape-dependent semantic ratings.",Machine Learning in Visual Information Processing

We propose to measure the relevant angels with Kohonen self organizing networks from an image of a heavy precision camera, instead of a projecting system clamped on the wheel. This has the clear advantage, that we do not need to attach a specially designed clamp which holds on to a wheel with mirrors, scales or LEDs. That for the target system will shot a photo from each wheel from a well determined position and calculate the relevant angels from it with Kohonen self organizing neural networks. We compare the utility for several distance measures to retrieve the best association map which determines the necessary coordinates. The system is designed as a learning system that needs a certain amount of training. The training is designed, that it surely converges after a well determined number of runs.

104,Graphical Model Based Approach for Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbines,"the lasso estimate, Wind turbine, pitch system","Wind turbine operation and maintenance costs depend on the reliability of its components. Thus, a critical task is to detect and isolate faults, as fast as possible, and restore optimal operating conditions in the shortest time. In this paper, a machine learning of graphical models approach is proposed for fault diagnosis of wind turbines, in particular pitch system. The role of the latter is to adjust the blade pitch angle by rotating it according to the current wind speed in order to optimize the wind turbine power production. This is achieved by a controller based on blade pitch angles measured by two redundant sensors in each blade. Without the sensor accuracy reading, the controller can be misled and fail to achieve the optimal control strategy according to the current operation conditions. In addition, pitch angle sensors complete failure can lead to dangerous actions of the controller, while fixed or drifted bias of sensor measurements may decrease the controller's efficiency. To better control and overcome these challenges, we propose a methodology that is based on Gaussian acyclic graphical models and the lasso estimate. The methodology has shown the ability to model, and diagnose faults that occur in the pitch system in wind turbines during its normal run and could lead to a fast recovery to the optimal operating conditions.",Machine learning of graphical models in static and dynamic complex environments
